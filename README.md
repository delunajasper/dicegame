# dicegame

Two player dice game created with HTML, CSS & Javascript. Each player rolls a dice and their scores are displayed. First to reach 100 points wins but this can be set to their liking. Player must choose hold to keep the score obtained. Otherwise points will be lost if double 1 is rolled; 40 points upon rolling double 6. Message is shown if the latter occurs.

                                
Learned the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML provides basic site structure, which is enhanced by CSS and behaviour is modified by Javascript. I learned the value of styling and Javascript's DOM manipulation.
                          
I would like to refactor the code using ES6 add a feature where players can steal points and also implement ReactJS to make a 3-D dice roll.
